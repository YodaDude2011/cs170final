<h3>Star Wars: Episode 3</h3>
<p>This specific Star Wars movie is my favorite because it showed the downfall of the Jedi and the new era of the Sith.
    When I was younger, I loved learning about the background lore of the Star Wars, so this concept interested me the most
</p>
<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>This movie is about giant humanoid mechs fighting Kaiju. 
    I loved the action in this movie.
</p>
<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>Midsommar is about a couple who go on a trip to Sweden, but the village is 
    run by a cult. The movie is a little scary and messes with your head. I like This
    type of thriller movie.
